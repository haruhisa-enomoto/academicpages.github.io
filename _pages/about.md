I am Haruhisa Enomoto (榎本 悠久 in Japanese), a postdoc at
[Graduate School of Science](https://www.osakafu-u.ac.jp/en/academics/graduate/g_science/),
[Osaka Prefecture University](http://en.nagoya-u.ac.jp/) in Japan.

**I moved from Nagoya to Osaka Pref. Univ. since April 2021.**

E-mail:
m16009t [at] math.nagoya-u.ac.jp
*(I can still use this Nagoya e-mail address, but later I'll change a new e-mail address when I will get it.)*

For more details, see [CV](/cv/). Here is [my old website](http://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~m16009t/), which will *not* be updated.

## Research Areas
- Representation theory of algebras (artin algebras, noetherian algebras)
- Homological algebra

## Research Interests
- Auslander-Reiten theory (via functor categories)
- Quillen's exact categories, extriangulated categories
- Subcategories of module categories (classifications and their properties as exact categories)
- $\tau$-tilting theory
- Combinatorial & computational aspects

## Position
[JSPS Research Fellow (PD)](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/) at Osaka Prefecture University. My host researcher is [Yuya Mizuno](https://researchmap.jp/y-mizuno?lang=en).

I am Haruhisa Enomoto (榎本 悠久 in Japanese), a postdoc at
[Graduate School of Science](https://www.omu.ac.jp/sci/en/),
[Osaka Metropolitan University](https://www.omu.ac.jp/en/) in Japan.


**Since April 2022, My e-mail address and affiliation has changed since the name of my university has changed.**

**New E-mail**:
henomoto [at] omu.ac.jp

(Old1: the35883@osakafu-u.ac.jp,
*I cannot use this address!!!!*)

(Old2 : m16009t [at] math.nagoya-u.ac.jp,
I can still use and check this Nagoya e-mail address)

For more details, see [CV](/cv/).

## Research Areas
- Representation theory of algebras (artin algebras, noetherian algebras)
- Homological algebra

## Research Interests
- Auslander-Reiten theory (via functor categories)
- Quillen's exact categories, extriangulated categories
- Subcategories of module categories (classifications and their properties as exact categories)
- $\tau$-tilting theory
- Combinatorial & computational aspects

## Position
[JSPS Research Fellow (PD)](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/) at Osaka Prefecture University. My host researcher is [Yuya Mizuno](https://researchmap.jp/y-mizuno?lang=en).

I am Haruhisa Enomoto (榎本 悠久 in Japanese), a postdoc at
[Graduate School of Science](https://www.osakafu-u.ac.jp/en/academics/graduate/g_science/),
[Osaka Prefecture University](https://www.osakafu-u.ac.jp/en/) in Japan.

**I moved from Nagoya to Osaka Pref. Univ. since April 2021.**

**New E-mail**:
the35883 [at] osakafu-u.ac.jp

(Old: m16009t [at] math.nagoya-u.ac.jp,
*I can still use and check this Nagoya e-mail address,
  but it will probably be unusable in the near future.)*

## Research Areas
- Representation theory of algebras (artin algebras, noetherian algebras)
- Homological algebra

## Research Interests
- Auslander-Reiten theory (via functor categories)
- Quillen's exact categories, extriangulated categories
- Subcategories of module categories (classifications and their properties as exact categories)
- $\tau$-tilting theory
- Combinatorial & computational aspects

## Position
[JSPS Research Fellow (PD)](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/) at Osaka Prefecture University. My host researcher is [Yuya Mizuno](https://researchmap.jp/y-mizuno?lang=en).

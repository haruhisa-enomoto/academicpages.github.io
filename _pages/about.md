I am Haruhisa Enomoto (榎本 悠久 in Japanese), a postdoc at
[Graduate School of Science](https://www.omu.ac.jp/sci/en/),
[Osaka Metropolitan University](https://www.omu.ac.jp/en/) in Japan.

**IMPORTANT**: I will leave math academia in March 2024 and join a company in April 2024. See [here (Japanese)](/acadexit/) for more details if you are interested in why I decided to leave academia.

This site will available after March 2024, but I haven't decided whether I will update this site or not, and its contents.

The e-mail address below will not be available after March 2024.

# [FD Applet](/fd-applet/) - an applet for Finite-Dimentional algebras has been released!

**Online version: <https://fd-applet.dt.r.appspot.com/>**

Since April 2022, My e-mail address and affiliation has changed since the name of my university has changed.

_New E-mail_:
`henomoto [at] omu.ac.jp`

(Old1: `the35883 [at] osakafu-u.ac.jp`,
_I cannot use this address!!!!_)

(Old2 : `m16009t [at] math.nagoya-u.ac.jp`,
I can still use and check this Nagoya e-mail address)

For more details, see [CV](/cv/).

## Research Areas

- Representation theory of algebras (artin algebras, noetherian algebras)
- Homological algebra

## Research Interests

- Auslander-Reiten theory (via functor categories)
- Quillen's exact categories, extriangulated categories
- Subcategories of module categories (classifications, their properties as exact categories, and combinatorics of the poset of subcategories)
- $\tau$-tilting theory
- Combinatorial & computational aspects

## Position

[JSPS Research Fellow (PD)](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/) at Osaka Metropolitan University. My host researcher is [Yuya Mizuno](https://researchmap.jp/y-mizuno?lang=en).

## Update History

- 2023-11-13: I gave [several talks](/talks/) and [received the Hida award](/cv/)!
- 2023-06-13: I gave an [introductory lectures of $\tau$-tilting and torsion classes using split projectives and wide intervals](/talks/2023-06-13/) in Japanese.
- 2023-04-04: Add **[FD Applet](/fd-applet/)**!
- 2023-04-04: New theme!
- 2023-02-03: New preprint [Maximal self-orthogonal modules and a new generalization of tilting modules](/papers/mso/), and add some related problems to [Questions](/questions/).
- 2022-11-22: I added a **counter-example** of a [Questions](/questions/) about the lattice-theoretical characterization of the lattice of torsion classes, and add a small [Program](/codes/) used to find it.
- 2022-09-10: [AR quiver calculator](/codes/) is now (probably) supported on Mac!
- 2022-08-31: New preprint [Image-extension-closed subcategories of module categories of hereditary algebras](/papers/ie-closed/) (with A. Sakai)!
- 2022-08-13: **Major update on [AR quiver calculator](/codes/)!**. Now this can compute various subcats (torsion classes, wide subcats, ICE-closed,...) and their Ext-projectives from your AR quiver visually!
- 2022-08-08: New preprint [Grothendieck monoids of extriangulated categories](/papers/et-monoid/) (with S. Saito)!
- 2022-06-03: Add **Representation theory of algebra in Lean** to [program](/codes/).
- 2022-05-16: **My e-mail and affiliation has changed!** since the name of my university has changed.
- 2021-08-07: I added [Questions](/questions/) page, where I raise some questions which I'm interested in but which I can't solve. _This page will be updated occasionally_.

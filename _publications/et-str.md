## Comment

In the [previous exact-structure paper](/papers/exact-str/), I gave a classification of exact structures of a given additive category using defects in functor category. In this paper, we give analogous results for **extriangulated categories** introduced by Nakaoka-Palu.

However, since we cannot recover triangulated structures from the category of defects (they always coincide with the category of finitely presented functors), we cannot expect a full classification of any (ex)triangulated structures. Instead, I investigate *substructures* of a given extriangulated structure.

For a given extriangulated category, I classify all possible substructures on it. More precisely, substructures are in bijection with Serre subcategories of the category of defects. As an application to exact categories, I proved that the lattice of exact structures on a given additive category is isomorphic to the lattice of Serre subcategories of some abelian category.

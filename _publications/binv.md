## Comment
As a generalization of the study of torsion-free classes over type A quiver in [my JHP paper](/papers/JHP/), we consider preprojective algebras and path algebras of Dynkin type and classify simples in their torsion-free classes $\mathcal{F}_w$ (Buan-Iyama-Reiten-Scott's category $\mathcal{C}_w$) by using its relation with the root system. I also give a method to find simples in a torsion-free class $\mathcal{F}$ by using maximal green sequence of $$\mathcal{F}$$ (or a path in the Hasse quiver from $\mathcal{F}$ to $0$) via their brick labeling by [DIRRT].

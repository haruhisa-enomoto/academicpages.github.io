## Comment
We continue studying **ICE-closed subcategories** of module categories (subcategories closed under taking *Images*, *Cokernels* and *Extensions*) from [my previous paper](/papers/rigidICE/), where the hereditary case was studied.
We succeed in generalizing this for any algebras, introducing wide $\tau$-tilting modules, a $\tau$-tilting object in some functorially finite wide subcategory.

To achieve this, we study ICE-closed subcategories via the hearts of intervals in the lattice of torsion classes (we borrow the word heart from the Tattar's paper, and is used in DIRRT, Asai-Pfeifer, and so on). We prove that *every ICE-closed subcats are realized as hearts of some intervals*, and characterize such intervals in a purely lattice-theoretic way.
Using this, we show that *ICE-closed subcategories are precisely torsion classes of some wide subcategories*. This enables us to use tau-tilting theory to classify ICE-closed subcategories. Moreover, we discuss how to compute wide tau-tilting modules from the support tau-tilting poset for the tau-tilting finite case.

I wanted an *analogue of Auslander correspondence for exact categories*, especially a kind of *CM Auslander correspondence for Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras*.

Since non-Morita equivalent algebras may give equivalent CM categories (as additive categories), to classify CM-finite Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras, one needs some extra info together with its CM category. That is (my favorite) *exact structure*, the structure of Quillen's exact category.
Then the original Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra can be recovered by taking the endomorphism ring of *progenerator* in this exact category.

To do this, For a given category, I classify possible exact structures by using functor category.
Also Auslander-Reiten theory for exact categories are studied.

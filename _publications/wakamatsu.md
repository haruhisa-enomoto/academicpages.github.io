## Comment

This paper studies the Morita type theorem for exact categories. The Ext-perpendicular category of cotilting modules are precisely exact category with progen & inj cogen & higher kernels.
Essentially I considered Auslander-Reiten's famous paper Applications of contravariantly finite subcategories in the context of exact categories.

Based on paper:
- [ICE-closed subcategories and wide &tau;-tilting modules](/papers/ice/)

## Abstract
I’ll introduce ICE-closed subcategories of an abelian length category, subcategories closed under taking Images, Cokernels and Extensions. Both torsion classes and wide subcategories of an abelian category are ICE-closed. We will see that ICE-closed subcategories are precisely torsion classes in some wide subcategories. For a finite-dimensional algebra, I’ll introduce the notion of wide &tau;-tilting modules, and extend Adachi-Iyama-Reiten’s bijection between support &tau;-tilting modules and torsion classes to a bijection between wide &tau;-tilting modules and ICE-closed subcategories. If time permits, I’ll talk about some results on ICE-closed subcategories over hereditary algebras and Nakayama algebras. This talk is based on a joint work with Arashi Sakai (Nagoya University).

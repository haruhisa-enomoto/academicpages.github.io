10-minutes flash talk, based on my paper
- [From the lattice of torsion classes to the posets of wide subcategories and ICE-closed subcategories](/papers/from-tors/)

## Abstract
I will show that we can construct the lattice of wide subcategories of the module category of a finite-dimensional algebra from the lattice of torsion classes only using its lattice structure. This enables us to check various properties of the lattice of wide subcategories using computer, and I will give some results and conjectures on this lattice.

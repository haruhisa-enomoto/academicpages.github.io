Based on paper:
- [Bruhat inversions in Weyl groups and torsion-free classes over preprojective algebras](/papers/binv)

## Abstract
In this talk, I propose to study exact-categorical structures of torsion(-free) classes of module categories. For functorially finite torsion-free class, indecomposable projective and injective objects are easily described by $\tau$-tilting modules, and in particular, the numbers of them coincide. However, there can be more simple objects in torsion-free class, which I propose to study. I explain that the number of simple objects controls the validity of the Jordan–H&ouml;lder type theorem in a torsion-free class.

Then I’ll talk about simple objects in a torsion-free class over the preprojective algebra (and path algebra) of Dynkin type, which is also important in Lie theory due to Geiss–Leclerc–Schr&ouml;er’s categorification of the cluster structure. By Mizuno’s result, we can associate an element $w$ of the Weyl group to each torsion-free class $\mathcal{F}$. By (extended) Gabriel’s theorem, $\mathcal{F}$ roughly corresponds to the inversion set of $w$, the set of positive roots which are sent to negative by $w^{-1}$. Then I show that simple objects in $\mathcal{F}$ are in bijection with Bruhat inversions of $w$, which are related to the Bruhat order of the Weyl group.

Based on my preprint:

- [Maximal self-orthogonal modules and a new generalization of tilting modules](/papers/mso/)

## Abstract

Wakamatsu tilting modules are a special type of orthogonal module that generalize both tilting and cotilting modules, and naturally arise in the context of exact categories. Recently, a new subclass of these modules called projectively Wakamatsu tilting modules has been introduced. In this talk, we will explain the basics of these modules and present some results: when the algebra is representation-finite, then (projectively) Wakamatsu tilting modules are precisely maximal orthogonal modules, and every orthogonal module can be completed into some Wakamatsu tilting module.

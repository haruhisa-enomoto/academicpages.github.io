## Comment
As a generalization of the study of torsion-free classes over type A quiver in [my JHP paper](/papers/JHP/), we consider preprojective algebras and path algebras of Dynkin type and classify simples in their torsion-free classes (Buan-Iyama-Reiten-Scott's category C_w) by using its relation with the root system. I also give a method to find simples in a torsion-free class F by using maximal green sequence of F (or a path in the Hasse quiver from F to 0) via their brick labeling by [DIRRT].

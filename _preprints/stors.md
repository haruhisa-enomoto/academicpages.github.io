## Comment
The **HRS-tilt** gives a poset isomorphism between  the posets of (i) "intermediate" t-structures of a fixed t-structure and (ii) torsion pairs in the heart of that t-structure.

On the other hand, **Asai-Pfeifer** and **Tattar** establish a poset isomorphism between the posets of (i) interval of a fixed torsion pair $[\mathcal{U},\mathcal{T}]$ and (ii) "torsion pairs" in the subcategory $\mathcal{T} \cap \mathcal{U}^\perp$.

In this paper, we show that these two bijections in triangulated categories and abelian categories are just special cases of a general bijection in extriangulated category. To treat these two examples, we need to introduce the *negative first extension structure* $\mathbf{E}^{-1}(X,Y)$ on extriangulated categories, which is an analogue of $\mathrm{Hom}(X,\Sigma^{-1} Y)$ in triangulated categories.

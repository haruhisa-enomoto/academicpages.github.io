## Comment

I consider when an exact category satisfies the Jordan-H&ouml;lder property, (JHP) (the uniqueness of decompositions of object into simple objects). I gave a characterization of it by using an invariant "Grothendieck monoid" of exact categories In many cases arising in the rep. theory of algebras, (JHP) is equivalent to "number of projectives = number of simples". I investigated simples in torsion-free classes over type A quiver by using the symmetric group, and observed that Bruhat order appears!

## Comment

As a generalization of triangulated and exact categories, we can naturally define the Grothendieck monoid $\mathsf{M}(\mathcal{C})$ of an extriangulated category $\mathcal{C}$. In this paper, we show the following.

- We can classify several subcategories of $\mathcal{C}$ using $\mathsf{M}(\mathcal{C})$:
    * Serre subcategories (natural generalization of those in an abelian cat)
    * Dense 2-out-of-3 subcategories (2-out-of-3 w.r.t conflations & additively generates $\mathcal{C}$)

- $\mathsf{M}(\mathcal{C})$ behaves well under the localization of $\mathcal{C}$ by a *good* subcategory $\mathcal{N}$, that is, $\mathsf{M}(\mathcal{C}/\mathcal{N})$ is isomorphic to the **monoid quotient** $\mathsf{M}(\mathcal{C})/\\{[N] \mid N \in \mathcal{N}\\}$. This can be applied to:
    - The Serre quotient of an abelian category by a Serre subcategory.
    - The Verdier quotient of a triangulated category by a thick subcategory.
    - The stable category of a Frobenius category.

- For an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ and its torsionfree class $\mathcal{F}$, we consider a subcategory $\mathcal{C} :=\mathcal{F}[1] * \mathcal{A}$ of the derived category of $\mathcal{A}$. This is extension-closed, so extriangulated. Then we show that $\mathsf{M}(\mathcal{C})$ is the **monoid localization** of $\mathsf{M}(\mathcal{A})$ with respect to $\\{[F] \mid F \in \mathcal{F} \\}$. Moreover, this subcategory is natural, since it is characterized by a subcategory $\mathcal{C}$ of the derived category with
    - $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under extensions and direct summands.
    - $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{A}[1] * \mathcal{A}$ holds.
So it is a subcategory **with width between $1$ and $2$** intuitively.

Also, we give some questions in the last section.
